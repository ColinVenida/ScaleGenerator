====Progress Log====

1/10/19

Added project to a Git repository!!! :)

fixed issue of NullReferenceException in the ScaleScene
	//issue was caused be the re-naming the ScaleScene to ScaleScene_temp
	//renamed the current scene to ScaleScene

I need to implement the new note systems to the other scenes BEFORE I figure out the 
function pipeline problem.  It is impossible to fix the pipeline problem if the scenes
don't work

I need to implement the ScaleGenerator class into the QuizScene
	-design:  ScaleGenerator will create a new scale with every new question
