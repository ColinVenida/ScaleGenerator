====Progress Log====

implement new note system to FretboardScene

implement feature:  show different scales on the fret board
	-make a drop down of the scales to use

	//to acheieve this, I had to refactor the ScaleGenerator class so it returns a NoteArray object when it generates
	//a scale instead of a string array.
	//then I had to muscle out the logic of how to put the notes of the scale on the proper frets.
	//Writing a proper/in-depth explanation of how the code/logic works has been added to the Task List

1/12/19
implemented the new note system to the QuizScene.  The Key toggles AND the sharp/flat option work in the scene!!!
	//I had to copy the ScaleGenerator GameObject from the ScaleScene and paste it into the QuizScnee
	//I had to remove the old references to "note" in the QuizScene code

	//I refactored the SetAnswerText(), SetQuestionText(), and GenerateRoot() functions to play nice with
	//the new ScaleGenerator monobehavior

The next feature to work on is in the FretboardScene

1/10/19

Added project to a Git repository!!! :)

fixed issue of NullReferenceException in the ScaleScene
	//issue was caused be the re-naming the ScaleScene to ScaleScene_temp
	//renamed the current scene to ScaleScene

I need to implement the new note systems to the other scenes BEFORE I figure out the 
function pipeline problem.  It is impossible to fix the pipeline problem if the scenes
don't work

I need to implement the ScaleGenerator class into the QuizScene
	-design:  ScaleGenerator will create a new scale with every new question
