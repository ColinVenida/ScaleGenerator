====TASK LIST=====

***Art Tasks***


redesign color scheme and buttons(?)
	-new colors/fonts/images for the background, titles and buttons


***Design/Programming Tasks***

[BUG]
	switching the arpeggio filters does not update the tooltip number at the bottom of the tooltip window



Fretboard: Add text to show the octave on 12th adn 24th fret

Implement saving feature to the QuizScene
	-Use a PlayerPref array or lots of booleans to save the checkbox status

properly document/refactor the classes (especially ScaleGenerator, and GuitString) to explain how the code works.
	//make sure all the variable/data structure names are also "music theory" correct (ie. scale intervals)

**Re-evalute what the scenes need after the new note system is implemented
	//what bugs are there?
	//is everything being saved?
	//update the Task List docs
	//etc.

adjust the graphics settings so the app looks consistent on different screen sizes. (I think this is done already [expanded background
beyond the camera])

***User Interface/Experience Tasks***

Have dropdowns change color when the viewport template is open


***Publishing Tasks***
Rollout a new internal test
	-I'm having trouble getting the app published to the internal testers.  Maybe a new internal test will fix it
		-email friends or Google for help?

Re-enable Google Analytics
	-put privacy policy into the App description and have a button inside the App that links to the privacy policy

***NEW FEATURE:  Lefty-Swap***   [NOT SURE IF I NEED THIS]
-add a checkbox that will reformat the fretboard/tuning buttons to show the note positions for
left-handed players


====COMPLETED TASKS====

************************************3/13-16/2020*******************************

BACK FROM THE DEAD!!!!

---
-Add scrollbar to the fretboard
	-extend fretboard to 24 frets

Create a fretboard graphic that adjusts in height
		Adjusted the fretboard's canvas anchor point to the top-left so it expands downward when scaled

create semi-transparent strings graphic
		Added a ScrollRect UI object and a Mask (UI?) to the fretboard GameObject.  This allowed me to increase the scale
		of the fretboard and GuitStrings sprites and also allowed the user to horizontally scroll the fretboard
----

-Have dropdowns automatically change position to show the selected item
	Created a new behavior that can be drag-dropped onto the UI Dropdowns.  Behavior sets the content's Y position based on
	what item is selected in the dropdown menu during it's OnEnable() function.  The behavior is not the most elegant, 
	but it works good enough :p.


************************************9/25/19*********************************
-removed Unity Data Analytics to avoid including a privacy policy in the app
	-will add again when privacy policy is ready
-published new version to Play Console for internal testing :]

9/22/19
-Add Modes to the QuizScene
-Added buttons to cycle through the tooltips window

8/20/19		[class has been removed]
-Added ArpeggioManager class to help with consistent user experience.  The app turns off the arpeggio filter when the scale
is changed, or when the root note is changed.


8/20/19
***NEW FEATURE:  Chord Arpeggios***
-add a Fretboard filter that shows the arpeggios of the selected chord
	-need to add a button/menu for the user to select what scale/arpeggio they want to display
	-need to research how arpeggios are formed/made
		-do they come from a specific scale?

8/11/2019
Post App to Google beta servers


[DATE]
***NEW FEATURE: Tooltip Menu***
-Add a button to each scene that will bring up a new window that consicely explains a basic music theory
-The content of the window will change based on what scale is being viewd
-examples of tooltips
	"The major scale is made up of same pattern of whole steps and half steps.  Starting from the root:
		[root] W W H W W W H [octave] "
	"The Mixolydian scale is the major scale, but with a flat-7th note"
	"something about enharmonics"


6/15/19
combined the scale generator into the FretboardScene for better usability
		//it was redundant/frustrating to have the scale generator and fretboard
		//on different scenes.  Why have the 

4/19/19
***The program saves dropdown values for the ScaleScene and Fretboard scene, NOT the QuizScene
refactor the Start() and Awake() functions to proper order.  This is affecting how the program saves the dropdown values
between Scenes
	[done]-list out all the functions that are currently in the Start(), Awake() and OnValueChanged functions		
	-list out functions that are essential and need to be done first
	-refactor logic to solve the OnValueChanged problem
	-put other functions into the Start() function ?

4/6/19
Scale Generator: Add modes to the scale generator drop down

Sacle Generator: Add diminished character to scale generator

3/25/19
Make demo video to show other musicians and programmers
	//take their feedback and adjust program from there

3/7/19
implement feature:  highlight same notes on user's touch
	-if the user touches a fret that is displaying a note, then the program changes that note
		and each note with the same string to a dark yellow color

3/2/19
implement feature:  determine whether a scale is theoretical or not and alert the user
	-program correctly determines theoretical scales 
		if there the scale is theoretical
			-the user is informed the scale is theoretical
			-the scale is correctly displayed on the ScaleGen and Fretboard scenes
2/20/19
implement new note system to FretboardScene

implement feature:  show different scales on the fret board
	-make a drop down of the scales to use

1/12/19
implemented the new note system to the QuizScene.  The Key toggles AND the sharp/flat option work in the scene!!!

1/10/19
implement version control to project
	-get Git on computer
	-google how to use Git with Unity
	-list what files need to be backed up for the project
