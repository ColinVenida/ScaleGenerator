====TASK LIST=====

***Art Tasks***
Create a fretboard graphic that adjusts in width

create semi-transparent strings graphic

redesign color scheme and buttons(?)


***Design/Programming Tasks***
Add scrollbar to the fretboard
	-extend fretboard to 24 frets

Fretboard: Add text to show the octave on 12th fret

Implement saving feature to the QuizScene
	-Use a PlayerPref array or lots of booleans to save the checkbox status

properly document/refactor the classes (especially ScaleGenerator, and GuitString) to explain how the code works.
	//make sure all the variable/data structure names are also "music theory" correct (ie. scale intervals)

**Re-evalute what the scenes need after the new note system is implemented
	//what bugs are there?
	//is everything being saved?
	//update the Task List docs
	//etc.


adjust the graphics settings so the app looks consistent on different screen sizes. (I think this is done already [expanded background
beyond the camera])


***NEW FEATURE:  Lefty-Swap***   [NOT SURE IF I NEED THIS]
-add a checkbox that will reformat the fretboard/tuning buttons to show the note positions for
left-handed players


====COMPLETED TASKS====

************************************9/25/19*********************************
-removed Unity Data Analytics to avoid including a privacy policy in the app
	-will add again when privacy policy is ready
-published new version to Play Console for internal testing :]

9/22/19
-Add Modes to the QuizScene
-Added buttons to cycle through the tooltips window

8/20/19		[class has been removed]
-Added ArpeggioManager class to help with consistent user experience.  The app turns off the arpeggio filter when the scale
is changed, or when the root note is changed.


8/20/19
***NEW FEATURE:  Chord Arpeggios***
-add a Fretboard filter that shows the arpeggios of the selected chord
	-need to add a button/menu for the user to select what scale/arpeggio they want to display
	-need to research how arpeggios are formed/made
		-do they come from a specific scale?

8/11/2019
Post App to Google beta servers


[DATE]
***NEW FEATURE: Tooltip Menu***
-Add a button to each scene that will bring up a new window that consicely explains a basic music theory
-The content of the window will change based on what scale is being viewd
-examples of tooltips
	"The major scale is made up of same pattern of whole steps and half steps.  Starting from the root:
		[root] W W H W W W H [octave] "
	"The Mixolydian scale is the major scale, but with a flat-7th note"
	"something about enharmonics"


6/15/19
combined the scale generator into the FretboardScene for better usability
		//it was redundant/frustrating to have the scale generator and fretboard
		//on different scenes.  Why have the 

4/19/19
***The program saves dropdown values for the ScaleScene and Fretboard scene, NOT the QuizScene
refactor the Start() and Awake() functions to proper order.  This is affecting how the program saves the dropdown values
between Scenes
	[done]-list out all the functions that are currently in the Start(), Awake() and OnValueChanged functions		
	-list out functions that are essential and need to be done first
	-refactor logic to solve the OnValueChanged problem
	-put other functions into the Start() function ?

4/6/19
Scale Generator: Add modes to the scale generator drop down

Sacle Generator: Add diminished character to scale generator

3/25/19
Make demo video to show other musicians and programmers
	//take their feedback and adjust program from there

3/7/19
implement feature:  highlight same notes on user's touch
	-if the user touches a fret that is displaying a note, then the program changes that note
		and each note with the same string to a dark yellow color

3/2/19
implement feature:  determine whether a scale is theoretical or not and alert the user
	-program correctly determines theoretical scales 
		if there the scale is theoretical
			-the user is informed the scale is theoretical
			-the scale is correctly displayed on the ScaleGen and Fretboard scenes
2/20/19
implement new note system to FretboardScene

implement feature:  show different scales on the fret board
	-make a drop down of the scales to use

1/12/19
implemented the new note system to the QuizScene.  The Key toggles AND the sharp/flat option work in the scene!!!

1/10/19
implement version control to project
	-get Git on computer
	-google how to use Git with Unity
	-list what files need to be backed up for the project
