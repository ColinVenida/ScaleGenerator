properly document/refactor the classes (especially ScaleGenerator, and GuitString) to explain how the code works.
	//make sure all the variable/data structure names are also "music theory" correct (ie. scale intervals)

**Re-evalute what the scenes need after the new note system is implemented
	//what bugs are there?
	//is everything being saved?
